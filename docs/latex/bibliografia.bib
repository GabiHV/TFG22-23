  abstract = {This book covers both classical and modern models in deep learning. The chapters of this book span three categories: The basics of neural networks: Many traditional machine learning models can be understood as special cases of neural networks. An emphasis is placed in the first two chapters on understanding the relationship between traditional machine learning and neural networks. Support vector machines, linear/logistic regression, singular value decomposition, matrix factorization, and recommender systems are shown to be special cases of neural networks. These methods are studied together with recent feature engineering methods like word2vec. Fundamentals of neural networks: A detailed discussion of training and regularization is provided in Chapters 3 and 4. Chapters 5 and 6 present radial-basis function (RBF) networks and restricted Boltzmann machines. Advanced topics in neural networks: Chapters 7 and 8 discuss recurrent neural networks and convolutional neural networks. Several advanced topics like deep reinforcement learning, neural Turing machines, Kohonen self-organizing maps, and generative adversarial networks are introduced in Chapters 9 and 10. The book is written for graduate students, researchers, and practitioners. Numerous exercises are available along with a solution manual to aid in classroom teaching. Where possible, an application-centric view is highlighted in order to provide an understanding of the practical uses of each class of techniques.},

  TITLE = {BMAE-Net: A Data-Driven Weather Prediction Network for Smart Agriculture},
  JOURNAL = {Agronomy},

  YEAR = {2023},
  NUMBER = {3},

  ABSTRACT = {Weather is an essential component of natural resources that affects agricultural production and plays a decisive role in deciding the type of agricultural production, planting structure, crop quality, etc. In field agriculture, medium- and long-term predictions of temperature and humidity are vital for guiding agricultural activities and improving crop yield and quality. However, existing intelligent models still have difficulties dealing with big weather data in predicting applications, such as striking a balance between prediction accuracy and learning efficiency. Therefore, a multi-head attention encoder-decoder neural network optimized via Bayesian inference strategy (BMAE-Net) is proposed herein to predict weather time series changes accurately. Firstly, we incorporate Bayesian inference into the gated recurrent unit to construct a Bayesian-gated recurrent units (Bayesian-GRU) module. Then, a multi-head attention mechanism is introduced to design the network structure of each Bayesian layer, improving the prediction applicability to time-length changes. Subsequently, an encoder-decoder framework with Bayesian hyperparameter optimization is designed to infer intrinsic relationships among big time-series data for high prediction accuracy. For example, the R-evaluation metrics for temperature prediction in the three locations are 0.9, 0.804, and 0.892, respectively, while the RMSE is reduced to 2.899, 3.011, and 1.476, as seen in Case 1 of the temperature data. Extensive experiments subsequently demonstrated that the proposed BMAE-Net has overperformed on three location weather datasets, which provides an effective solution for prediction applications in the smart agriculture system.},
